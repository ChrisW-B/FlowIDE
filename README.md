# FlowIDE

Add first-class Flow support to Sublime Text! FlowIDE provides autocomplete, diagnostics, type hints, and jump-to-definition for the [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) static type checker for JS. FlowIDE provides the majority of Flow-related features implemented in Facebook's [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io/)

## Usage
Install with Package Control!

FlowIDE features only activate on files with the `// @flow` declaration.

### Diagnostics and Autocomplete
Just works! Autocomplete generates snippets with parameter names when pressing `Enter`.

### Type Hints
Press `Command+Option+T` (`Control+Alt+T`) to view the type of the variable or function underneath your cursor.

### Jump-to-Definition
Press `Command+Option+J` (`Control+Alt+J`) to jump to the definition of the variable, function, or type underneath your cursor.
